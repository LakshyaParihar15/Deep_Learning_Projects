## 📂 Projects

### 1. Sentiment Analysis from Text using Deep Learning 📝📊
- **Objective**: Classify text data as positive or negative using a deep learning model.
- **Key Features**:
  - Preprocessing of raw text data using tokenization, padding, and cleaning techniques.
  - Built a Sequential Neural Network using Embedding, LSTM, and Dense layers.
  - Trained and validated the model on a labeled sentiment dataset.
  - Evaluated performance using accuracy and visualizations of training metrics.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, NLTK, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Use Case**: Helpful in social media monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and understanding public opinion.

### 2. Vegetable Image Classification using CNN 🥕🌽🥦
- **Objective**: Classify different types of vegetables from images using a Convolutional Neural Network.
- **Key Features**:
  - Loaded and preprocessed image data from a structured directory.
  - Built a CNN model with Conv2D, MaxPooling2D, Flatten, and Dense layers.
  - Trained on multiple vegetable classes with data augmentation techniques.
  - Achieved high accuracy and tested the model on new image samples.
- **Technologies Used**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, Matplotlib
- **Use Case**: Can be applied in smart farming, automated checkout systems, and agricultural classification tasks.
